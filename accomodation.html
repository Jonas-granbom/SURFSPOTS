    <div><h4>Keramas Resort</h4><img src="img/keramasresort.jpg" alt="">
        <p>With its pristine volcanic beach, this beachfront Bali resort offers a wonderful experience of spending
            leisure time in a natural luxury hotel. We feature impressive 4-star rooms and suites and 5-star beachfront
            pool accommodation and 1, 2 and 3 bedroom villas.

            Our Beach Club was voted in the top 5 in Asia and the executive chef brings his worldwide cuisine experience
            to the dishes. Inviting entertainment and exquisite nibbles from Asia, Europe, and Australia are being
            served in themed night dinners. The body deserves a reward after a hard day in the surf, and our Joglo Spa
            understands how to pamper the body - from head to toe.

            Bring the whole family. Whether you’re looking for a family surf holiday or mum and dad want a little
            kids-free time, we’ve got something for everyone. Kids will love hanging out at our kids club, with daily
            activities, playground and skatepark. We have family suites available, babysitting and a kid-approved
            menu. </p></div>
